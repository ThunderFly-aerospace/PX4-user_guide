# ThunderFly TFRPM01 Revolution Counter

The [TFRPM01](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFRPM01) tachometer is a small, and low system demanding revolution-counter.

The board itself does not include the actual sensor but can be used with many different sensors/probe types for revolution counting.
It has an I²C connector for connecting to PX4 and is connected to the actual sensor via a 3-pin connector.
It also has an LED that offers basic diagnostic information.

:::note
The TFRPM01 sensor is open-source hardware commercially available from [ThunderFly s.r.o.](https://www.thunderfly.cz/) (manufacturing data is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFRPM01)).
:::

## Hardware Setup

The board is equipped with (two through pass) I²C connectors for connecting to PX4 and has a 3-pin connector that can be used to connect to various sensors:
- TFRPM01 may be connected to any I²C port.
- TFRPM01 has a 3pin pin-header connector (with pull-up equipped input) that can be connected to different probe types.
  - The sensor/probe hardware needs a pulse signal.
    The signal input accepts +5V TTL logic or [open collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collector) outputs.
    The maximum pulse frequency is 20 kHz with a 50% duty cycle.
  - The probe connector provides a +5V power supply from the I²C bus, the maximum power which could be used is limited by RC filter (see schematics for details).

TFRPM01A electronics is equipped with signaling LED that can be used to check that the probe is connected properly.
The LED lights up when the pulse input is grounded or exposed to logical 0, so you can check the probe is working correctly just by manually spinning a rotor.

### Multiple sensors
For many purposes, it is advisable to have a connection and the ability to read the frequency from multiple tachometers simultaneously. The number of connected devices is limited by the number of addresses set of the sensor and the number of available I2C busses. The sensor supports two addresses, which means that two sensors (with different addresses) can be connected to 1 bus. The sensor replacement procedure can be found in the [sensor documentation](https://github.com/ThunderFly-aerospace/TFRPM01#ic-address-configuration) page. 

### Hall-Effect Sensor Probe

Hall-Effect sensors (magnetically operated) are ideal for harsh environments, where dirt, dust, and water can contact the sensed rotor.

Many different hall effect sensors are commercially available.
For example, a [5100 Miniature Flange Mounting Proximity Sensor](https://m.littelfuse.com/~/media/electronics/datasheets/hall_effect_sensors/littelfuse_hall_effect_sensors_55100_datasheet.pdf.pdf) is a good choice.

### Optical Sensor Probe

An optical sensor can also be used (and may be a better fit, depending on the measurement requirements).
Both transmissive and reflective sensor types may be used for pulse generation.

## Software Setup

### Starting driver

The driver is able to start automatically if a parameter that turns this driver on is set. Parametr `[SENS_EN_PCG8583](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#SENS_EN_PCF8583)` must be set to 1. 

:::note

If you do not see this parameter in the parameter list, make sure you are using a version later than **** . If you are using a newer version, you may need to [add the driver to the firmware](../peripherals/serial_configuration.md#parameter_not_in_firmware):
```
CONFIG_DRIVERS_RPM=y
```
:::



If multiple sensors are available, they will be indexed by address and then by bus. For example:

1. 0x50 I2C1
2. 0x50 I2C3
3. 0x51 I2C1
4. 0x51 I2C2


### Parameters
The parameters are commonf for all instances. 

| Parameter name | Default value | Description |
| ----- | ------ | ----- |
| PCF8583_POOL | 1000000 [us] | How often sensor is read out |
| PCF8583_RESET | 500000 [ticks] | When to clear counter |
| PCF8583_MAGNET | 2 [pcs] | Number of signals per one revolution |

#### Start driver from console

Start the driver from the [console](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/analyze_view/mavlink_console.html) using the command:
```
pcf8583 start -X -b <bus number> -a <i2c address>
```
where:
- `-X` means that it is an external bus.
- `-m <bus number>` is the bus number to which the device is connected 
- `-a <i2c address` is address of TFRPM sensor. Default address is 0x50.


### Testing

You can verify the counter is working using several methods

#### PX4 (NuttX) MAVLink Console

The [QGroundControl MAVLink Console](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/analyze_view/mavlink_console.html) can also be used to check that the driver is running and the UORB topics it is outputing. 

To check the status of the TFRPM01 driver run the command: 
```
pcf8583 status
```
If the driver is running, the I²C port will be printed along with other basic parameters of the running instance.
If the driver is not running it can be started started using theprocedure described above. 

The [listener](../modules/modules_command.md#listener) command allows you to monitor RPM UORB messages from the running driver. 
```
listener rpm
```
For periodic display, you can add `-n 50` parameter after the command, which prints the next 50 messages.

#### QGroundControl MAVLink Inspector

The QGroundControl [Mavlink Inspector](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/analyze_view/mavlink_inspector.html) can be used to observe MAVLink messages from PX4, including [RAW_RPM](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#RAW_RPM) emitted by the driver:

1. Start the inspector from the QGC menu: **Analyze tools > Mavlink Inspector**
1. Check that `RAW_RPM` is present in the list of messages (if it is missing, check that the driver is running).


### Parameter Setup

Usually, sensors can be used without configuration, but the RPM values should correspond to multiples of real RPM.  It is because the `PCF8583_MAGNET` parameter needs to correspond to the real number of pulses per single revolution of the sensed rotor. 
If needed, the following parameters should be tweaked:

* [PCF8583_POOL](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#PCF8583_POOL) — pooling interval between readout the counted number
* [PCF8583_ADDR](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#PCF8583_ADDR) — I2C sensor address
* [PCF8583_RESET](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#PCF8583_RESET) — Counter value where the counted number should be reset to zero.
* [PCF8583_MAGNET](../advanced_config/parameter_reference.md#PCF8583_MAGNET) — Number of pulses per revolution e.g. number of magnets at a rotor disc.

:::note
The parameters above appear in QGC after the driver/PX4 are restarted.

If the configuration parameters are not available after restart then you should check that the driver has started.
It may be that the [driver is not present in the firmware](../peripherals/serial_configuration.md#configuration-parameter-missing-from-qgroundcontrol), in which case it must be added to the board configuration:
```
drivers/rpm/pcf8583
```
