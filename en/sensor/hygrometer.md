# Hygrometers

A hygrometer is an instrument used to measure the moisture content in the environment, typically expressed as relative humidity. Humidity sensors are uasually accompanied by temperature sensor. Hygrometers are crucial in various industries and applications, including meteorology and particularly in aviation. 

## Importance of Hygrometers in Aviation

In aviation, accurate humidity measurements are vital for several reasons:

1. **Flight Safety:** Humidity affects the density of air, which in turn influences lift and engine performance.
2. **Weather Prediction:** Understanding humidity levels is key for predicting weather conditions, including cloud formation, precipitation, and storms.
3. **Instrument Accuracy:** Many onboard instruments are sensitive to humidity, which can cause errors if not properly monitored and compensated for.
